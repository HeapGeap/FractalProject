The program builds several fractal objects according to given formulas. For building object you need to click the ***'Generate'*** button, then select the fractal you are interested in. <br>

The friability and appearance of the fractal depends on the parameters passed to the function ***'paint'.*** <br>

Conceptually, there was also a settings section for the ability to zoom in and out of an object, and study its self-reproduction. Currently the described function is not available.
